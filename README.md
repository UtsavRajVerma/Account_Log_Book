## What is password management?  ##
Passwords are a set of strings provided by users at the authentication prompts of web accounts. Although passwords still remain as one of the most secure methods of authentication available to date, they are subjected to a number of security threats when mishandled. The role of password management comes in handy there. Password management is a set of principles and best practices to be followed by users while storing and managing passwords in an efficient manner to secure passwords as much as they can to prevent unauthorized access.

## What are the challenges in password management?  ##
* Login spoofing - Passwords are illegally collected through a fake login page by cybercriminals.
* Sniffing attack - Passwords are stolen using illegal network access and with tools like key loggers.
* Shoulder surfing attack - Stealing passwords when someone types them, at times using a micro-camera and gaining access to user data.
* Brute force attack - Stealing passwords with the help of automated tools and gaining access to user data.
* Data breach - Stealing login credentials and other confidential data directly from the website database.

## Traditional methods of password management ##
* Writing down passwords on sticky notes, post-its, etc.
* Sharing them via spreadsheets, email, telephone, etc.
* Using simple and easy to guess passwords.
* Reusing them for all web applications.
* Often forgetting passwords and seeking the help of 'Forgot Password' option.
